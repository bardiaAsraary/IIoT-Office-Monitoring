Overview
The Sensor Simulator is a Python script that generates and publishes simulated environmental sensor data (temperature, humidity, light, occupancy) for various office zones. It uses MQTT to send data, making it ideal for testing IoT dashboards or pipelines, such as the Node-RED dashboard in this project.

Features
Simulates multiple office zones (e.g., reception, workspace, meeting).

Publishes realistic random sensor data.

Publishes to MQTT topics at regular intervals.

Configurable via a JSON settings file.

Graceful shutdown on keyboard interrupt.

Configuration
The simulator reads its settings from .vscode/settings.json.
Example configuration:

json
{
  "broker": "localhost",
  "port": 1883,
  "client_id": "OfficeSimulator",
  "zones": ["reception", "workspace", "meeting"],
  "publish_interval_seconds": 10,
  "topics_format": "office/{zone}/data",
  "sensor_ranges": {
    "temperature": [15, 30],
    "humidity": [30, 70],
    "light": [0, 1000],
    "occupancy": [0, 1]
  }
}
broker: MQTT broker address (e.g., localhost)

port: MQTT port (default: 1883)

client_id: MQTT client identifier

zones: List of simulated office zones

publish_interval_seconds: Time (seconds) between data publications

topics_format: Format for MQTT topics (e.g., office/{zone}/data)

sensor_ranges: Min/max values for each simulated sensor

How It Works
Loads configuration from .vscode/settings.json.

Connects to the MQTT broker using the Paho MQTT client.

Simulates sensor data for each zone:

Temperature: 20â€“25Â°C

Humidity: 40â€“70%

Light: 0â€“1000 lux

Occupancy: 0 or 1 (absent/present)

Publishes data to topics like office/reception/data.

Repeats at the configured interval until interrupted.

Usage
1. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install paho-mqtt
2. Configure the Simulator
Edit .vscode/settings.json as needed (see above).

3. Run the Simulator
bash
python src/sensor_simulator.py
4. Stopping
Press Ctrl+C to gracefully stop the simulator.

Example Output
text

Customization
Add/Remove zones: Edit the zones list in the config.

Change sensor ranges: Edit sensor_ranges in the config.

Adjust publish interval: Change publish_interval_seconds.

Change MQTT topic format: Edit topics_format.

Troubleshooting
Connection failed: Ensure the MQTT broker is running and accessible.

Import errors: Install all dependencies.

Config errors: Double-check .vscode/settings.json for typos or missing fields.
